# 线程基本

A thread is a thread of execution in a program. The Java Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently.
线程是程序中执行的线程。 Java虚拟机允许应用程序同时运行多个执行线程。

Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are executed in preference to threads with lower priority. Each thread may or may not also be marked as a daemon. When code running in some thread creates a new Thread object, the new thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of the creating thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if the creating thread is a daemon.
每个线程都有优先权。优先级较高的线程优先于较低优先级的线程执行。每个线程可能也可能不会被标记为守护进程。当在某个线程中运行的代码创建一个新的Thread对象时，新线程的优先级初始设置等于创建线程的优先级，并且当且仅当创建线程是守护进程时，守护线程才是。

When a Java Virtual Machine starts up, there is usually a single non-daemon thread (which typically calls the method named main of some designated class). The Java Virtual Machine continues to execute threads until either of the following occurs:
当Java虚拟机启动时，通常有一个非守护线程（通常调用一些指定类的main方法）。 Java虚拟机继续执行线程，直到出现以下任一情况：

* The exit method of class Runtime has been called and the security manager has permitted the exit operation to take place.
* 类Runtime的退出方法已被调用，并且安全管理器已允许退出操作发生。
* All threads that are not daemon threads have died, either by returning from the call to the run method or by throwing an exception that propagates beyond the run method.
* 所有不是守护线程的线程都已经死了，要么从调用返回到run方法，要么抛出一个超出run方法的异常。

There are two ways to create a new thread of execution. One is to declare a class to be a subclass of Thread. This subclass should override the run method of class Thread. An instance of the subclass can then be allocated and started. For example, a thread that computes primes larger than a stated value could be written as follows:
有两种方法可以创建一个新的执行线程。一个是将一个类声明为Thread的一个子类。这个子类应该重写类Thread的run方法。然后可以分配和启动子类的一个实例。例如，计算大于所述值的素数的线程可以写成如下：

```java
  class PrimeThread extends Thread {
    long minPrime;
    PrimeThread(long minPrime) {
      this.minPrime = minPrime;
    }
    public void run() {
      // compute primes larger than minPrime
      // . . .
    }
  }
```
The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
下面的代码会创建一个线程并开始运行：

```java
    PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);
    p.start();
```

Every thread has a name for identification purposes. More than
one thread may have the same name. If a name is not specified when
a thread is created, a new name is generated for it.
每个线程都有一个用于标识的名称。 更多一个线程可能具有相同的名称。 如果名字没有指定的时候一个线程被创建，一个新的名字被生成。
